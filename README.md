WASD + space to move. 

Abilities:
DASH at 3 creeps squashed. SHIFT to activate. 
DOUBLE JUMP after reaching the shop (the cube that subtracts 6 credits). Press SPACE while in the air to activate.

Credits:
This was all based off of the "First 3D Game" godot tutorial under the 2d tutorial linked on canvas. 
I used ChatGPT to help me write some of the scripts behind the dash and double jump. 

Time spent:
I would say this took me about 5 to 6 hours alltogether to get the different levels, abilities, and figuring out the collision to make barriers.
