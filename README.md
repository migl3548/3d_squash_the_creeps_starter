WASD + space to move. 

Abilities:
DASH at 3 creeps squashed. SHIFT to activate. 
DOUBLE JUMP after reaching the shop (the cube that subtracts 6 credits). Press SPACE while in the air to activate.

Credits:
This was all based off of the "First 3D Game" godot tutorial under the 2d tutorial linked on canvas. 
I used ChatGPT to help me write some of the scripts behind the dash and double jump. 

Time spent:
I would say this took me about 5 to 6 hours alltogether to get the different levels, abilities, and figuring out the collision to make barriers. 

Weekly Requirements:
1 faucet and 1 sink: Squishing the creeps gives you one credit, unlocking the double jump ability from the "shop" (a cube) subtracts 6 credits and unlocks the double jump.
Progression unlocks: When you squish 3 creeps, you are automatically granted the dash ability.
1 hard gate and 1 soft gate: The wall in the second area is only able to be jumped over after unlocking the double jump ability. I was going to add an extra area that has some parkour that's doable but hard without the double jump as my soft gate but I didn't end up implementing that as it would have taken way too much additional time and I plan on starting a new game after this week.
